This is our terrible source tree.

To use it get SBCL (we use Common Lisp) on Linux.

Then (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'dysfunkycomm)

At the repl, enter

(in-package #:dysfunkycom)

Then
	(visualise-scenario 1001)
or any other submission number.

This uses SDL to display everything.

Or 

   (write-many-submissions (list 1001))
