Compilation Instructions
------------------------
1. Get the needed libraries (see http://cliki.net/), ie.
  iterate alexandria cl-fad lispbuilder-sdl ieee-floats
(some of these are included in the addons subdirectory).
2. Put (a symbolic link of) dysfunkycom.asd in your ASDF system registry path.
3. Fire up SBCL, do a (require :dysfunkycom), eliminate problems as needed :)
4. (in-package :dysfunkycom)

Watching the scenario
--------------------
(visualise-scenario 1001)

Creating submissions
--------------------
1. Make sure that the .obf files are on the path.
2. Call (write-many-submissions '(2001 2002 2003 ...) :prefix "/tmp/663-")
   ... where of course '(2001 2002 2003 ...) and "/tmp/663-" are to be changed.

You can visualize a submit file with
  (visualise-submission "/tmp/663-2001.osf")
and there may be other cool features included in this package.
(note the *auto-zoom* and *visualise-max-radius* variables)

For the 4th problem, we have another controller, called
  problem-4-fixed-order-controller
with which you can fix the order of satellites (using 'FUEL for refueling).

As for the algorithm, there's not much time left, so just believe that it
works :) But we'll be happy to answer your questions after the contest.
